  <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
  <p>
    Hidden Insight Labs works with experimental and emerging technologies
    that lack established testing standards. Engagements are designed to
    surface usability issues, technical risk, and deployment constraints
    before systems reach real users.

  <h2>What We Work On</h2>
  <ul class="pillars">
    <li>Augmented and mixed reality applications</li>

  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  <p>
    Projects are typically short, focused engagements with a clearly defined
    scope. We emphasize direct testing, field observation, and structured
    evaluation rather than speculative design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Findings are documented in written reports intended for technical,
    product, and leadership audiences.
